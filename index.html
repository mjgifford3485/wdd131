                <p>My name is Matthew Gifford. I grew up in a little town in Colorado named Fruita. I moved up to the
                    Seattle area of Washington State about ten years ago. When I first moved up here, my Grandpa told me
                    I was going to get sick of the rain. Well, that still hasn't happened. In fact, I'm probably the
                    only person in the state who thinks it doesn't rain enough around here. I love to play games, though
                    I mostly play only video games and tabletop roleplaying games. I have spent most of my life working
                    on computer hardware. When I was a kid I liked to tear apart and build computers. I never spent much
                    time writing software, so I am very excited to be in the Software Development program here at BYU.

                <h3>Washington State</h3>
                <img src="images/washington-flag.webp" alt="Washington Flag">
                <p>Washington state is known as the Evergreen State. Washingon is home to some of the largest companies
                    in the world, including Amazon, Nintendo of America. Microsoft, and Starbucks. Washington is also
                    home to Mt St Helens, one of the largest active volcanoes in the world. Washington has over 1,000
                    earthquakes a year, but since most of the are relatively small, most people don't realize they even
                    happen.
